# 5 dof-Articulated-robotic-arm
Mini Project

Proud to share the successful completion of our minor project â€” a **5-Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) articulated robotic arm** designed for **pick-and-place operations**.

##  Key Highlights
-  **Lightweight structure** using PVC and 3D-printed components  
-  Controlled via **Arduino Uno** and **PCA9685** servo driver  
-  **Python-Tkinter GUI** for real-time manual control  
-  **Payload capacity:** 150g  
-  **Reach:** 65cm  
-  Powered by **MG996R** and **SG90** servo motors  

## ðŸ’¡ Project Focus
This project demonstrates the feasibility of **low-cost robotic automation** for **educational and industrial applications**, combining mechanical design, electronics, and software integration.
